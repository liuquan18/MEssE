discussion about writing a project proposal:
- need to clarify which grant we apply for 
- figure out what information needs to go into the proposal
- work on AICON in parallel to get initial results that can go into proposal 
- start writing background/motivation section of proposal (literature review/what's new)
- how long are we really willing to work on this project (not for years)
- fellowships are generally for one person only. What about funding options for two people?
- have a sharelatex document to write a grant proposal template
- Dependence of grant proposal on job status (i.e. unemployed, postdoc PhD etc...)
 
FOR NEXT TIME:
- Arjun: Work on filling out grant proposal template with content from presentation as starting point
- Quan: Clean up code. Try to reproduce results shown in presentation in repository. Create issue in github about comin/yac
- Both: Clarify the workflow on github (working on same or different branch)
